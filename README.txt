TimeNote

A simple note-taking application that automatically calculates the reading time of the text you are writing.

I looked for some software that did this, but I couldn't find anything on the internet, so I decided to create my own. I'm making it available here as an open-source program
I found it quite useful for when you need to narrate something and want automatic feedback on how long it will take to read what you're writing.

It's especially useful for those who record videos.

You can switch to dark mode by going to
Theme > Dark - to switch back to light mode, just repeat the process.

In the notepad, anything between two ## will not be calculated
for example: #title#

This function is for adding some notes or even titles without impacting the reading time calculation of the actual text.

The program generates a .json file to save the theme and WPM settings you change.
The default WPM is 130; if you delete the .json file, the program settings will be reset.

The use of the program is free; you can use and distribute it as you wish. If you want to modify the code, it's also up to you.
